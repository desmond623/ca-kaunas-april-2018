I I wake up in the mornings
falling halfway thrugh the roof
There's a loud distorted screaming in my head 
Everything is dark and empty
And I don't care bout how to fix this
So I jump up off a roof
And grunt out FUCK in the comfort of my shoose

[Bridge]
I don't know why
I fall like shit
I say I'm fine but I'm not fine

[Chorus]
I'm dead inside
And i can't fight the voices
I try to hide
All my real feelings
I'm dead inside
And i cant fight the voices
I try to fake all my expressive feelings 

[Verse 2]
I think there's something wrong with me
Cause all I see is pain
Everytime I climb outside
I look like I've been dragged behind a truck
And I climb for nineteen hours on a monday afternoon
And every now and then I scrach up bones
And I don't know what to do

[Bridge]
I don't know why
I feel like shit
I will not see a mentalist

[Chorus]
I'm dead inside
And i can't fight the voices
I try to hide all my real feelings
I'm dead inside
and sometimes i hear voices
I try to hide all my real feelings
